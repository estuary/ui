# Estuary UI

The web UI for Estuary Flow.

# How do I run it?

To get it started please look at build.md

# What is the status?

The status very much a "work in progress"... or like one level above a proof of concept.

# Building Blocks

This project was started using [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) and [added TypeScript](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript).

As we are currently using [MUI](https://mui.com/core/) as our main component library so we used [their typescript template](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/tree/master/examples/create-react-app-with-typescript) as a reference for this project. We combined some of their tsconfig settings with those found from [typescript-cheatsheets](https://github.com/typescript-cheatsheets/react#troubleshooting-handbook-tsconfigjson).
