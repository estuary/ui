# What is this?

These are renderers where we are just adding different default functionality that JSONForms does not provide. This stay in their own folder just to make it clear that these should stay REALLY close to the originals.

We follow JSONForm's folder structure to make it easier to bring over updates and know where stuff came from. We also disable certain linting rules for this folder so that we don't have to alter their code anymore than we need to.

# How do they stay in sync?

We have to check after every JSONForms update if these need updated.

# Current Customizations

1. A oneOf renderer for the parser format property
