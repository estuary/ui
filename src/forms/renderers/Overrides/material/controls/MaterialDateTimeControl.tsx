// This is SUPER customized
// Customizations:
//  1. Use Static Date Time Picker
//      We stopped using the MUI DateTimePicker and switched to the static one
//      This allows us to format the input only when the user is using the date
//      picker. The original approach would try to format the input on every keystroke
//      and it made it difficult to edit.
//  2. Use Date Fns
//      We already have a date format library so DayJS was not needed. Also, it
//      tries REALLY hard to understand what a user is meaning and will basically
//      work around almost anything you type and give you a date back. Example:
//      if a user types "2020" into the input then DayJS immedietly will format that to
//      something like "2020-01-01T01:00:00Z"
//  3. Mess with data format
//      We always want to send back an actual "Z" with this input and never send
//      back an actual time zone offset. To accomplish this we just mess with the
//      value onChange. However, to make sure when a user opens the DateTimePicker
//      it opens to their selection we need to feed the data back into the picker.
//      This requires that we remove the "Z" (that we inject) before opening the picker
//      otherwise the picker will try to adjust the timezone again.
