# What is this?

This houses all the custom/overwritten **renderers** that we use. However, this is not everything related to customization. Make sure you also look in `/src/services/jsonforms/` for more.

# Custom Renderers

These are stored in the root of the `renderers` directory. These are normally used when we want to target a specific kind of schema property and do not want it to impact default functionality.

# Overrides

These are all under the `overrides` directory. These are ones where we fully replace the standard JSONForms version with our own.
